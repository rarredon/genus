# genus.py
Python program to compute genera of surfaces into which simple 4-valent rigid vertex graphs can be embedded.

genus.py should be run from the command line in the same folder as dowlib.py.

If the program is run with no arguments a usage message will be printed.

For formal definitions and some properties of the genus range and genus spectrum see the documentation on pages 23-38 in my Master's thesis: http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/4979/ 

This program was developed as part of a research project at the University of South Florida with help from advisors Natasha Jonoska and Masahico Saito. The project was supported in part by NSF grant DMS-0900671 and NIH grant 1R01GM109459-01.
